_Q. Is there ${image not listed inside release} image?_

A. Not really, unless it's available on earlier releases.

- When it comes to *Ubuntu jammy* - you may [request an image](https://github.com/hexdump0815/imagebuilder/issues/129) (but it will take unspecified amount of time)
- When it comes to *Debian-derivatives* (not Ubuntu)(like Kali/Raspbian) - You may try adding distro repo to your sources.list, [like here](https://github.com/hexdump0815/imagebuilder/issues/225#issuecomment-2162170254) *(do not open issues about it, discussions are fine for this)*
- *Unrelated distro* - Build it yourself, this framework should have all ya need in scripts directory if you know how to bootstrap your distro. *(do not open issues about it, this is out of scope of the project)*
